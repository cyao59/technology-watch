# Export BigQuery Table Schemas to Excel

This Python script exports the schemas of specified BigQuery tables to an Excel file. Each table schema is written into a separate sheet in the Excel file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `google-cloud-bigquery` library
- `pandas` library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install google-cloud-bigquery pandas

## Usage
Replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual Google Cloud project ID, dataset ID, and list of table names.

project_id = 'your-project-id'
dataset_id = 'your-dataset-id'
tables_list = ['table1', 'table2', ...]  # List of table names
output_excel = 'schema_tables.xlsx'
Run the script using the following command:

``` python
python export_table_schemas_to_excel.py
```

The script will generate an Excel file named schema_tables.xlsx in the current directory containing the schemas of the specified tables, with each table schema written into a separate sheet.

# Notes
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the specified BigQuery dataset and tables.
The script assumes that you have set up authentication for Google Cloud SDK. If not, you can set up authentication by following the instructions here.
